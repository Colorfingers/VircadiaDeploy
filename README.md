# Vircadia Deploy

Tools for deploying the Vircadia server. You will find instructions for using these tools in each of the folders. 
## Docker
Using Docker we will be able to quickly stage the Vircadia domain server on Linux hosts.  Future work will perform load balancing of containers using Kubernets.
